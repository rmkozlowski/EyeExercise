# EyeExercise
In this assignment for MIT xPRO, I was able to practice mouse events. The code was presented with an eye already on the page. My job was to add a second "eye" element that follows the mouse movement on the page. With the directions and comments provided for this assignment, I specifically checked the code for mouse movement and proper For loop syntax.
