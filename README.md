# EyeExercise
Description: 
In this assignment for MIT xPRO, I was able to practice mouse events. The code was presented with an eye already on the page. My job was to add a second "eye" element that follows the mouse movement on the page. With the directions and comments provided for this assignment, I specifically checked the code for mouse movement and proper For loop syntax.

How to run:
Using all three files (index.html, eyes.js, styles.css) all one has to do is open the program and move the mouse across the page. This allows the eye to follow the mouse movements. 

Road-map: 
This program would be a fun screensaver, and has a simple function to demonstrate interaction with mouse-movement. In the future, one could add code to make the colors change at the click of the mouse to make things more dynamic.

Road-map:
To make this program stronger, once could write a feature that calculates the distance from stop to stop. It would be interesting to incorporate exact times of the stops, as well.
